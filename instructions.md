Hello, can you create a small sample project in Python language, with Dockerfiles for 2 docker images; 
one image should contain all data in a Postgres database, you can take a convenient docker base image from dockerhub. 
The second image with our small Python project should use the database of the first image, it should load and store data to it. 
Please also create a docker compose file and a Readme about how to use the docker compose and dockerfiles. 
The python project should not contain more than 1200 lines of code, 
it could use public data accessible by an API or calculate data using advanced data science Python libraries like Numpy or Pandas. 
Please also provide suitable database entities for the Postgres database. The database should contain simple database entities, 
and not more than 4 total database entities.

Can you extend the previous example project with Python so that a user can enter additional user and order data and 
can also enter a command to list existing users and another command to list orders of a specific user?
