1) follow the Readme

2) Build and run the Docker containers
$ docker-compose up --build


3) Access the database

The PostgreSQL database will be accessible on localhost:5432. You can connect to it using any PostgreSQL client with the following credentials:

    Username: user

    Password: password

    Database: sampledb
    
3*) instead of accessing the database, possible to query data in interactive Python application:
 * use "docker attach <container-id>
 to attach your shell to the running container, running the Python application.
 The menu option in the Python sample application are the following:
 Choose an option:
	1. Add a new user
	2. Add a new order for an existing user
	3. List all users
	4. List all orders for a specific user
	5. Exit

    Note: orders contain only a date and amount, not a actual item name!
    
4) Check the application logs

The Python application will fetch data from the API, process it, and insert it into the database. 
You can view the logs in the terminal where you ran docker-compose up.


5) Stopping the Containers

To stop and remove the containers, run:
bash
Copy

docker-compose down

### Summary

This extended version of the project now includes a CLI that allows users to interact with the database by adding new users and orders, 
and by listing existing users and orders. The CLI is integrated into the main application and can be accessed when running the Docker containers. 
This makes it easy to manage and query the database directly from the command line.
