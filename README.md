# Sample Python and PostgreSQL Project with Docker

This project demonstrates a simple Python application that interacts with a PostgreSQL database. The application fetches data from a public API, processes it using Pandas, and stores the results in the database. Additionally, it provides a command-line interface (CLI) for adding new users and orders, and for listing existing users and orders.
